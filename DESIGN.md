## Background

The Community Event Calendar App is designed to allow a small community to manage and organize their events efficiently. The application will enable users to view events, apply to participate, and for administrators to create and update event details.

## Requirements

**Must have:**
- A calendar page to view all upcoming events.
- Filter options on the calendar page to view either all events or only those the user has applied to.
- An event page for each event, displaying the title, description, and date.
- Functionality for users to apply to events.
- Admin page for creating and modifying events.

**Should have:**
- User authentication to track and manage individual applications to events.

**Could have:**
- Integration with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar) to sync events.

**Won't have:**
- A chat or forum feature for discussions on the event pages.

## Method

### Architecture Overview

The application will be developed using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. MongoDB will be used as the database.

#### Backend (Node.js)
- **Express.js** - To manage HTTP requests and routing.
- **Authentication Service** - Implements JWT for user authentication and admin verification.
- **API Gateway** - Routes authenticated requests to appropriate services.
- **Event Management Service** - Manages CRUD operations for event data.

#### Frontend (React)
- **React Router** - Manages navigation between the calendar, event details, and admin pages.
- **State Management** - Utilizes React Context API for managing application state.

#### Database Schema

- **Users Collection**
  - `userId` (ObjectID)
  - `email` (String)
  - `password` (String)
- **Events Collection**
  - `eventId` (ObjectID)
  - `title` (String)
  - `description` (String)
  - `date` (DateTime)
  - `applicants` ([ObjectID])

## Implementation

1. **Setup Development Environment** - Configuring Node.js and React environments, initializing project repositories.
2. **Database Setup** - Installing and configuring MongoDB, creating collections.
3. **Backend Implementation** - Developing core services like Authentication, API Gateway, and Event Management.
4. **Frontend Implementation** - Setting up React application, developing admin, listing, and event details pages.
5. **Integration** - Integrating frontend with backend services, ensuring secure communication.
6. **Testing** - Conducting unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
7. **Deployment** - Deploying the application on cloud platforms, setting up CI/CD pipelines.
8. **Post-Deployment** - Monitoring and refining the application based on user feedback.

## Milestones

- **Milestone 1: Environment Setup and Database Configuration** - 2 weeks
- **Milestone 2: Backend Core Services Implementation** - 4 weeks
- **Milestone 3: Frontend Pages Development** - 4 weeks
- **Milestone 4: Full System Integration and Testing** - 2 weeks
- **Milestone 5: Deployment and Initial Feedback Collection** - 1 week

## Gathering Results

Evaluation of user feedback and performance metrics to determine the success of the application post-launch, with adjustments made based on real-world usage.
